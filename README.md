# MID

**MID - Multiple Interface Downloader**

## Overview

* MID is a HTTP download accelerator.
 
* Traditional HTTP download accelerators use HTTP range requests to achieve this. 

* MID also uses HTTP range requests to achieve download acceleration but it takes it to the next level by involving multiple interfaces in the download (hence bandwidth boost)
