NAME
 MID - Multiple Interface Downloader

SYNOPSIS
 {MID | mid} {--url | -u}  URL [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
 MID is a HTTP[S] download accelarator. MID tries to send HTTP range requests through multiple network-interfaces to boost the download speed.
 MID unit (downloading unit) requests a specific part of the file and replicate it locally on the disk. MID units work in parallel to complete the download

 MID supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

OPTIONS
 --url argument is mandatory. URL should be a valid HTTP[S] url
 
 Other options:

   --output-file file                   -o file             Specify the output file, if not specified MID will automatically detect from the URL.

   --interfaces nic1,nic2...            -i nic1,nic2...     Network-interfaces which are used in the file download.

   --exclude-interfaces nic1,nic2...    -ni nic1,nic2...    Network-interfaces which are excluded from the file download.

   --help                               -h                  Print the help message and exit.

   --url URL                            -u URL              File at the URL to be downloaded.

   --max-parallel-downloads x           -n x                Maximum x number of parallel connections are allowed.

   --max-unit-retries x                 -Ur x               Maximum x number of retries are made by a unit to download a chunk. If failed, the download is terminated.

   --max-redirects x                    -R x                Maximum x number of HTTP redirects are followed.

   --max-tcp-syn-retransmits x          -Sr x               At max x TCP SYN are retransmitted when initiating a TCP connection.

   --unit-sleep-time x                  -Us x               Download unit sleeps for x seconds before retrying.

   --progress-update-time x             -Pu x               Information related to download progress updates after every x seconds.

   --detailed-progress                  -Pd                 Show detailed download progress.

   --version                            -V                  Print the version and exit.

   --header h=v                         -H h=v              Add custom headers to HTTP request message (option can be used multiple times to add multiple headers).

   --quiet                              -q                  Silent mode, don't output anything.

   --verbose                            -v                  Print the verbose information.

   --vverbose                           -vv                 Print the very verbose information.

   --surpass-root-check                 -s                  If had the sufficient permissions, use -s to surpass the root-check.

   --conf file                          -c file             Specify the configuration file path. Preference order: cmd_line > conf_file > default_values
       
NOTE
 For binding to a network-interface, MID uses SO_BINDTODEVICE socket-option. This generally requires elevated (super user) permissions and CAP_NET_RAW capability.
 So super user check is performed when application is invoked. If the program is not invoked as super user, it terminates printing the mentioned note. 
 If you beleive you have sufficient permissions, then pass {--surpass-root-check | -s} argument to surpass the super user check.
 But note that the program wont complain, it just hangs and terminates after sometime (after --max-tcp-syn-retransmits). 

RETURN VALUE
 The program returns 0 when the download was successful. 1 if error occured before the download was started. 2 if the download started and was interuptted.
 3 if there was a fatal error because of the lack of library support. 4 unexpected behaviors, might or might not be an error. 

EXAMPLES
 The trivial file download is performed as follows:
 	
 	# {MID | mid} --url http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.2/kali-linux-2019.2-amd64.iso

 The {--detailed-progress | -Pd} argment can be used to make MID display the detailed stats
 	
 	# {MID | mid} --url http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.2/kali-linux-2019.2-amd64.iso -Pd

 The {--include-interfaces | -i} and {--exclude-interfaces | -ni} can be configured to limit MID to use particular network-interfaces in the file download.
 Both options can be configured together and MID performs include-interfaces - exclude-interfaces to determine the interfaces which are used in the download
 	
 	# {MID | mid} --url http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.2/kali-linux-2019.2-amd64.iso -ni lo
 	
	(Loopback interface is excluded and all other interfaces are used in the download)
	
	# {MID | mid} --url http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.2/kali-linux-2019.2-amd64.iso -i eth0,wlan0
	
	(Only eth0,wlan0 are used in the file download)
	
	# {MID | mid} --url http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2019.2/kali-linux-2019.2-amd64.iso -ni eth1 -i eth0,eth1
	
	(Only eth0 is used in the file download)
	
FILES
 /etc/MID/MID.conf - System-wide configuration file.
 
 Use MID.conf file to make the settings persistent. The oder of preferefernce is command_line > conf_file > default_values
